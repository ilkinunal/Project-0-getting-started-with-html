    <br><b> How the Web Works? </b>
    <br>When a user opens a web browser and writes www.udacity.com, the computer sends an HTTP request to a server. The server finds the HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer , the web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

    <br><b> HTML</b>
    <br>HTML has “Text content” (what you see), “markup” (what it looks), “references to other documents” (images, videos, etc), “links to other pages”.
    <br>HTML consists of a series of codes typed into a text-file by the programmer; 
    <li>  
    <b>TAGs</b> - use <b>< angle-brackets ></b>,most tags have opening and closing tag, but some called “void” tag which does not require a closing tag. 
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Element</b> – includes <b>opening tag</b> & <b>content</b> & <b>closing tag</b>. Elements can be <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>; Block elements create an "invisible box" around the content inside of them, such as “p”, “div”, “form”. “a”, “span”, “br”, “img” and “strong” are all inline elements.
   	</li>
    <li>
    <b>Attribute</b> – provide additional information about an element , are specified in the opening tag.
    </li>
